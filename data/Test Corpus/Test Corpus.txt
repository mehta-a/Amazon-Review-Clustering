And you run and you run to catch up with the sun but it's sinking, racing around to come up being you again.
The sun is the same in a relative way but you're older, shorter of breath and one day closer to death.
Every year is getting shorter, never seem to find the time, plans that either come to naught or half a page of scribbled lines.
